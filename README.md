# CBW's Jupyter Book Documentation

This is the repo that hosts the CBW's Jupyter Book documentation website.

DEV RULES:
- all links to the web should create a new tab for it: use html code:
```
<a href="placeholder.com" target="_blank">Opens in new tab</a>
```

Notes:
- when building the website for these docs, you're going to get a lot of warnings about headers, this is just because there are some non-consecutive headers, you can ignore

BUGS:
- Primary sidebar toggle button does not work well (the way it works defeats its point)
- To-do list markdown not formatting correctly


To-Do List
- EXPLAIN MERGE CONFLICTS
- FIND A BETTER WAY TO SHOW TABLES (schedule)

Suggestions:
- add timing of downloads/installations (VSCode, python, jupyter book)
- add code chunk option to the file setup explanation code chunk, so that this takes up the width of the entire page?
- add border (css styling) to instruction pictures
- best practices section ?
