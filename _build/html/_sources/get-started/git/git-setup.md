# Git Setup

What is GitHub? 

GitHub is a version control tool. This means that your workshop team can all make changes, and the different versions can be uploaded to your repository (or "repo") on GitHub. Hence, multiple people can edit, and if something goes wrong, we can look at the history of your repo to find a working version.

We will be making edits locally (in VSCode!) and then putting them online.




If you are have already setup an SSH connection your PC, go ahead and [git clone](git-clone)!
