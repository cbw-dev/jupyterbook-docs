# POC Pages

Here are just example pages, where I got code to render/compile

Main worries:

- it might only work for the way I configured my kernels (see Julia_LabNotes, or just look at the Jupyter Book documentation)


A lot of these pages are taken from the POC pages from the Jupyter Book version of INR-Recreate-2024-JB (https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/file-types/jupytext.html)
