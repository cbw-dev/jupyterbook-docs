# CBW's Bookdown Documentation

Welcome to CBW's documentation for creating a workshop website using Jupyter Book. Jupyter Book is a tool that helps create different formats to host text, images, code and more! We will be using it to create our workshop website!

You only need to know markdown and whatever coding language you will be using to learn bookdown!

Note, this is the documentation to create a workshop using *Jupyter Book*. If **Bookdown** suits you better, see <a href="https://cbw-dev.github.io/bookdown-docs/" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you don't know which one to use, use the following flowchart to help decide!
