## Common Mistakes

- Make sure to save your files before building!
- Make sure you are looking at the proper output file!
    - If you have a file you are working on open in your browser, and you are not seeing updates as you save and build, make sure you are looking at the right output file.
    - For example, if you change the name of your file, the output file name will also change. Hence, open the file given by the Jupyter Book build output, and not necessairly what you had open in your browser before.
